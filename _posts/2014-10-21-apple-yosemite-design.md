Yosemite is very much here and I have installed it on my Macs at home. A few things jumped out at me straight away and I wanted to discuss them.

## Goodbye Lucida
The first thing I noticed was the lack of Lucida, and the introduction of Helvetica as the font choice for the OS. I can see why this has been done - to mirror iOS more closely, but Helvetica is a poor choice for a UI. Don’t get me wrong, its a design classic - but used at small sizes reveals Helvetica’s legibility problems.

Interestingly there are more and more work arounds to replace the standard OS font in Yosemite. I installed this [one](https://github.com/schreiberstein/lucidagrandeyosemite) and it actually feels kinda weird. It is MUCH more legible as a UI, but I think its letter forms contrast against Yosemite's & iOS8's more geometric proportions. So I think I will revert back to the standard font.

## Transparency
The second thing I noticed, was the introduction of the blur/transparency from iOS8. My initial reaction was that of displeasure. However, spending more time with Yosemite in day day to use made me realise that this use of transparency is a great way to keep the OS out of your way.

I saw some interesting before and after screen shots of iOS6 and iOS7 showing how much darker, and heavier iOS6 looked.

Notice how much the UI of iOS 6 seems to take over from the content. Whereas on iOS 7/8 it's all about the content. 

Now lets look at 10.9 v 10.10 for comparison:

You can see that like iOS,  OSX10.10 keeps out of your way and this is so true of Safari. Notice the way the background colours morph into the UI. And with the reduced height of the main tool bar area - it feels like you have more room for your web pages. I believe Dieter Rams once said: *Good design is unobtrusive*

## What's new is old
A friend mentioned to me that he thought OSX10.10 reminded him of OS7-9 (How many of you remember those days?) I kinda laughed it off at first. Then I saw this [Tweet](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/524286087917608961) showing how the OS looks when turning on ‘High Contrast Mode’… and I think you’ll agree - it does look very much like OS 7-9.

All in all I think Yosemite is a great upgrade. And another inch closer to having one OS across all Apple's devices. *(Which will happen.)*

Obviously there are lot more upgrades than I have discussed, but these two for me are the first things I noticed, which actually have a massive visual impact.
