# Facebook’s design problem(s).

I read an [interesting article](http://dcurt.is/facebooks-predicament) from Dustin Curtis where he talks about how a more beautiful looking Facebook was canned because the design was too good and people were not viewing their friends profiles or events - therefore missing out on Facebook’s key revenue stream: advertising. 

### The canned Facebook redesign:

Dustin goes on to say that Facebook are in a predicament = If the site is too beautiful, people will not use it in a way that is profitable to Facebook.

> But design is about solving problems, not just making things pretty.

I’d class this story as an old classic: either a poor brief - where the designer(s) were not given the correct, or enough information. Or this was a poor design as it clearly did not fulfil the brief - _if the brief was to keep users interacting with adverts._ 

This goes to show how important a thorough and honest briefing document is to a designer. _Ask any designer and they will tell you they never get a good enough brief._

This is a classic example.
