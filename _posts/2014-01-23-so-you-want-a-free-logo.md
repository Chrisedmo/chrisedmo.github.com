So today Squarespace unveiled “Squarespace Logo”, a web app allowing anyone to easily create a logo with quite basic vector icons borrowed from the wonderful [Noun Project](http://www.thenounproject.com), and fonts from [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts).

## There's a storm a'brewin…

Shortly after this announcement, a lot of designers, and even current squarespace users were [not happy](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23squarespacelogo&src=tyah) with this announcement. The general consensus being that the work of designers, and particularly logo designers was being undermined. 

> I must admit, when I read the tweets, I sank in my chair a little bit. Were my days doomed? 

Out of morbid curiosity I opened up the site and had a play, like a bucket of cold ice to a fire, my fears were quickly extinguished. 

Let's get things straight - This tool is a basic tool, with limited features, but it has been carefully crafted to allow most users to make an 'ok' or modern looking logo. They'll never be the most bespoke, or thought out logos – _that's why and when you would go to a proper designer or an agency._

In the end, it's not as if this tool is a particularly new concept. People have been able to create free logos in Word for years now… and I know I'd rather take a logo created with this site, over a logo created in word any day… and in the end, that's probably why the guys at Squarespace created this. They obviously care about design. And hopefully more restrictive tools like this will make people more 'design aware' which is never a bad thing.
