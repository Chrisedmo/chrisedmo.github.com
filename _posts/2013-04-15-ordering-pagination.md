Whilst working on my new site, I came across an interesting problem.

I am featuring my blog posts on my home page as a horizontal feed. With this approach, it makes sense to feature the latest blog posts to the left, with older posts of to the right. This is similar to having new blog posts at the top, and older posts below.

However, whilst doing my research for this redesign, I saw a few blogs and news sites that feature pagination in the form of a 'next' / 'prev' post, which are either pinned to the edge of the screen, or are left and right aligned, inline, similar to how I am paginating posts (see the end of this page).

###Now here's the interesting part, most of the site feature the 'new posts' link to the right, with the 'older posts' linking to the left as I guess this is how books have been for years… you 'turn' to the new page. 

However, digital pagination has always been the other way round. (Think of all those sites that feature 'page x of x'. Or my aforementioned blog example.)

I decided to switch it round for my blog, and feature the new posts the left and older to the right. (Have a look below this article or any other article for that matter) This also reflects the way the blog posts are listed on my home page and that of digital pagination. 

What do you think? Do you think it makes sense, am I over thinking this, or all of the above?
