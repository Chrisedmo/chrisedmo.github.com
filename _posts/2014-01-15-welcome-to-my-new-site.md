It's 2014 and I have a new website! This site is technically my 3rd personal website 'release', and the first with a blog. Which is pretty rubbish really, but let me explain…

This version is technically a late New Years resolution. I set the goal in 2011 to get my new site live for 2012, then 2012 happened. So I tried for 2013, and 2013 happened. (To be fair - my first child was born in January 2013 so I don't feel too bad about missing the 2013 deadline.)

## Death to the database and the CMS
My new site took longer than expected due to a number of reasons. The first was technology choice – I went back and forth from wordpress, to various other CMS'. In the end I went with a [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) powered site, hosted via github, well github [pages](http://pages.github.com) to be precise. This meant a bit of a learning curve, but it is one that I am glad I took. Jekyll seems to be gaining popularity, especially with people getting fed up of bending CMS' to do what they need. Shortly afterwards I found out that Jekyll use the [liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org) language for its templating language which is what the awesome [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/?ref=chris-mousdale) uses.

And the final piece in the tech stack is github pages - which use Jekyll. So my site is now open source, so you can view the source [here](http://github.com/chrisedmo/chrisedmo.github.com/) and raise issues, and I can try out new branches and keep track of all my changes. It's really liberating to have all this built in, and to not have to worry about a bloody database or sql file. 

Actually, the final, final piece of the tech stack is the tool I use to compose my blogs with: the excellent [iaWriter](http://www.iawriter.com) I can write and compose blog posts using the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax. I can do this anywhere as have this app on all my devices and they're all synced via iCloud. 

## A cobbler‘s child never has shoes
The final reason for the delay is me. I must have gone through 30+ different designs and ideas. It's the worst thing being your own client – it should be the creative freedom that we all strive for… but it just **never** ends, unless you set some rules or goals. 

## Onwards and err… upwards?
So my goals for the new site are
<ul>
	<li>to have a blog that I can easily update </li>
	<li>and one that lets me easily change the look and feel of each post easily (which was very easy to set up with thanks to Jekyll's support for alternative layouts, and includes)</li>
	<li>to show my photography more (I have set my blog up to feature large images where possible)</li>
	<li>to get back into illustration and photography - this is achieved in the aforementioned point.</li>
</ul>

So there, here it is… and I hope you enjoy it. if not - file a report on github, or add a comment when I get round to adding in disqus comments.
