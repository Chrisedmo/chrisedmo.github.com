Stand back, I'm writing a book! 

But first, a bit of history. I've been a professional designer since 2001. Back then my work was all print based, with the odd occasional email footer, or some web graphics for those 'web guys'. I never saw or talked to these people. I put them in the same camp as the IT guys, like some mythical nerds. 

## The web was just jpegs of your designs.
Then I started to contribute to a skating magazine in my own time. And one day they told me they were going to try out some 'online content' and asked if I could design for this. I obliged without knowing what this would mean. I ended up designing flat jpegs around 800px x 600px and then they made them clickable, essentially just like a crude PDF.

This little experiment got me interested in this website stuff. And since that day, I tried to make my own holding page. V1 was just a big jpg with a background colour that repeated. Then on V2 I started with HTML and this thing called CSSâ€¦ I think i was getting hooked.

	<p>It felt exciting, it felt new. It also felt incredibly restrictive and weird. Why couldn't I use whatever fonts I wanted!? Arial - What?</p>
</blockquote>
Back to my day job, and we were getting more and more demand for websites. So I started to design more websites, and using photoshop in a very different way to how I had been using it for the last few years.

## The web is not just jpegs of your designs.
Fast forward 10 years, and things have progressed an awful lot. You can pretty much use whatever fonts you want now. Layouts are much more like print layouts. The tools for designing sites are changing all the time. In fact, for me  Photoshop takes a back seat when it comes to website designs.

## It's good to pass it on.
I'm now a full time web designer. I can also comfortably build websites. I thought I would write a book on my journey and the lessons I have learnt whilst making this transition. I see a lot of designers confused with ['responsive' web design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design), or just designing for screens, rather than books. And whilst the tools and tech may change from month to month. I wanted to share the fundamental things I have learned. Like learning to let go of the idea of a 'fixed canvas', or that sites should look like your PSD's.

## CMYK to RGB Book
I have set up a site for the book, with an email sign up. So please take a look and sign up if you are interested. Or let someone that you think might like the book know about it.

The more demand I have the quicker I will try and get it finished.
