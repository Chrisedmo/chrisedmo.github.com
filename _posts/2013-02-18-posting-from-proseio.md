title: Testing posting from prose.io?
short: Prose.io is a lovely lightweight 'CMS' for giuthub pages

I've recently linked my jekyll blog, which is hosted on [github](http://github.com) pages to [prose.io](http://prose.io) which is a browser based Markdown editor - which is perfect for my set up.

It works really nicely. I have added prose.io to my bookmarks bar.
