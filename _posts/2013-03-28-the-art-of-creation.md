# A creative must create…

I recently found some old recordings my old band made a while ago, along with some ideas that i recorded on my own. I plugged in my headphones and started t go through the 50+ tracks and listen whilst at work. 

The first feeling that came was nostalgia. Remebering tims with the old band, what the songs were about and what were the chords?

Some of the tracks were actually pretty good (ahead of their time I'll say…), and some got me questioning whether I was a better guitar player then, or now? But what I really came away with is that i need to create more. Create more music, create more paintings, create more photographs. I'm at my happiest when i'm creating.
